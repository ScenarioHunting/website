Scenario Hunting reduces the gap between design and code. It's the quickest way to spike the design, and to cover the model by safety net. Scenario Hunting leads to causal consistency assurance across design elements before starting to code them. It puts flesh to the abstract scenarios from the design to the point that the test code can be autogenerated from the scenarios, to get instant feedback from the design decisions, and streamline communication, onboarding, and training.

### Why Scenario Hunting?

* It helps to make the right decision, based on the right data, at the right level while switching from design to implementation. 
* It communicates using a simple, abstract, but familiar language which can be easily understood by both humans and machines. 
* It reduces the gap between design and implementation. 
* It encourages you to focus on model and behavior  first, and then switch to code. 
* It assists you to explicitly uncover the causality behind the elements of the model, and discover the missing ones. 
* It helps to design drive test scenarios as abstract concepts and then extract them as code. 
* It helps new developers to onboard spontaneously, and quickly get familiar with the coding standards, and test automation policies. 
* It improves confidence and delivery speed. 
* It greatly reduces the cost of yoyo problem, human memory errors, and mis-translation of model to the code. 
* It's designed as a very simple and straightforward workflow. 
* It can be used at different levels (Domain, API, and Service)
* It helps to discover and extract not only the behavior of the subject under test, but also it's public API in terms of fields of types, and classes and signatures of functions, and methods. 
* It's collaboration friendly.
