Scenario Hunting reduces the gap between design and implementation. It's the fastest way to spike the design, and to cover the model by safety net. 
Scenario Hunting leads to causal consistency assurance across design elements before forging them to code. It helps to streamline communication, onboarding, and training.

### Why Scenario Hunting?

* It fills the gap between design and implementation. 
* It greatly reduces the cost of yoyo problem, human memory errors, and mis-translation of model to the code. 
* It's the fastest way to spike the design.
* It's the fastest way to cover the model by safety net.
* It encourages you to focus on design and behavior before implementing them as code. 
* It assists you to explicitly uncover the causality behind the elements of the model, and discover the missing ones. 
* It helps to design drive test scenarios as abstract concepts and then extract them as code. 
* It helps new developers to onboard spontaneously, and quickly get familiar with the coding standards, and test automation policies. 
* It improves confidence and delivery speed. 
* It's designed as a quick, simple and straightforward process. 
* It communicates using an abstract, but intuitive language which can be easily understood by both humans and machines. 
* It can be used at different levels (Domain, API, and Service)
* It helps to discover and extract not only the behavior of the subject under test, but also it's public API in terms of fields of types, and classes and signatures of functions, and methods. 
* It helps to make the right decision, based on the right data, at the right level while switching from design to implementation. 
* It's collaboration friendly. 
* It helps business people and developers have deeper insight and communication.
