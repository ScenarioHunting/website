A software design workflow which maximizes knowledge discovery by asking to clarify causality across design elements, then automatically forges the artifacts into test code to get instant feedback from the design decisions, and streamline communication and training.

### Why Scenario Hunting?
* It uses a language which can be easily understood by both humans and machines. 
* It reduces the gap between design and implementation. 
* It encourages you to focus on model and behavior  first, and then switch to code. 
* It assists you to explicitly uncover the causality behind the elements of the model, and discover the missing ones. 
* It helps to design drive test scenarios as abstract concepts and then extract them as code. 
* It helps new developers to onboard spontaneously, and quickly get familiar with the standard coding, and test automation policies. 
* It improves confidence and delivery speed. 
* It greatly reduces the cost of yoyo problem, human memory errors, and mis-translation of model to the code. 
* It's designed as a very simple and straightforward workflow. 
* It can be used at different levels (Domain, API, and Service)
* It helps to discover and extract not only the behavior of the subject under test, but also it's public API in terms of fields of types, and classes and signatures of functions, and methods. 
* It's collaboration friendly.
