        <h3>What is Scenario Hunting and Why it Matters?</h3>
        <p>
            Scenario hunting accelerates revealing deeper insights into your models. The quickness of the process allows
            individual developers to asynchronously ensure the practicalities of the proposed model during modeling
            workshops. Developers hunt for the most critical scenarios, grasp valuable feedback, and share it with
            stakeholders to update the model collaboratively and make more informed decisions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Traditionally, we used to separate the modeling “phase” from the implementation “phase” (even if we don’t
            refer
            to them as separate phases). However, there are some caveats to that approach. In practice, things may
            diverge
            during the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are humans. We’re not compilers. We’re unable to compile the hypothetical model on sticky notes. So we’re
            unable
            to ensure that the model is practical. The model represented on sticky notes may not integrate into the rest
            of the
            system. Our
            theoretical model may not be consistent. An algorithm may not be implementable. The time complexity of a
            mathematical algorithm may turn out to be factorial, and so on. Yes, these are the details. But some of them
            can
            impact the model, if not the business.
        </p>
        <p>


        <blockquote>
            “Designing information systems is kind of fractal. There are things that matter at all levels of detail, and
            there are tiny details that invalidate grand assumptions, and there are grand assumptions that prevent
            effective
            progress at the level of tiny details.”
            <br>
            <cite>Dave Farley</cite>
        </blockquote>

        </p>

        <p>
            The core domain is usually complex. If the core domain isn’t complex enough, it might lack a significant
            competitive
            advantage. We often arrange modeling workshops mainly to tackle the complexity of the core domain, and the
            complexity may reside at its different levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            While design can be considered a single concern at all levels, we need different tools to tackle it at
            different levels.
            The ultimate model is the working code. As long as we don’t have that working code, the model is
            hypothetical.
        </p>

        <p>
        <blockquote>
            “Software development is a learning process; working code is a side effect.”
            <br>
            <cite>Alberto Brandolini</cite>
        </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>

            The problem is that sticky notes are not directly compilable. We can’t run and test them to see if the model
            works. The less certain we are about one part of the model, the less confidently we can design its
            dependencies. So we need to be able to turn the model behind those sticky notes into code to compile and
            test them without
            losing track. Scenario hunting minimizes the paradigm shift penalty at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
            It helps you to quickly drill down into a small piece of the model at a time. Turn it into code and run the
            tests.
            Even if a single test fails after implementing the scenario, it informs you that the new scenario
            cannot be integrated with the existing code base or that the proposed model is inconsistent and it’s
            deviating from the planned expectations in practice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>


            When we separate the modeling “phase” from the implementation “phase”, not all stakeholders might be
            available during the
            implementation;
            even if they were, they wouldn’t have easily remembered the context; even if they did, it wouldn't be
            feasible to interrupt them all each time to gather and make a new decision.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>

            Scenario hunting leverages the risk. During modeling workshops, developers are distributed among
            groups
            of people and hunt for scenarios from the most indeterminate parts of the model to ensure their
            practicalities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After the workshop, they continue hunting scenarios and grasping deeper insights into the model. As they
            implement
            scenarios, they mark them on the board and share their feedback on the board when necessary. The feedback
            may affect
            the rest of the system, update the model, or help them make more informed decisions. Feedback collection
            facilitates breakthrough achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process keeps the model up-to-date and provides better living documentation than a discrete pile of
            gherkin
            scenarios stakeholders never bother reading once implemented.

        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        Scenario hunting helps to keep the model more practical and precise. It allows developers to focus on what
            matters
            and keep the living documentation alive. It also enables developers to treat modeling and implementation as
            a single
            task, improving their productivity and mental health because they incur less cognitive switching penalty.
        </p>
            <p>

        Scenario hunting reduces the gap between modeling and implementation. You reflect the exact model as code and
        protect the modeling proposal from deviation while implementing it. Scenario hunting helps developers to stay
        focused on the model and leverages the compiler to reveal potential hidden complexities behind proposed solutions.
